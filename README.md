### How to use

- In the initialize function, change the username to your username. This makes sure the problems solved by you dont appear on the list
- In the save_list function, uncomment the commented lines if you want to save it to a .txt file.
-Adjust rating in the lower_bound part of initialize function
- run ```python3 app.py```

and thats all you need to do!
